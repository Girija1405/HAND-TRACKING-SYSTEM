#  Real-Time Hand Tracking with MediaPipe & OpenCV

This project uses Python, MediaPipe, and OpenCV to detect and track hands in real-time using a webcam. It visualizes 21 hand landmarks and draws connections between them, enabling gesture-based interaction systems.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

## Features
- Real-time webcam-based hand tracking
- 21 keypoint landmark detection (fingers, joints, palm)
- Custom drawing styles for landmarks and connections
- Optimized with detection and tracking confidence settings

## Installation

Install required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
